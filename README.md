# CS2 Cheat Detector

### A Counter-Strike 2 Anti-Cheat plugin built on CounterStrikeSharp, designed to protect your server from cheaters in real time.

***Our system goes beyond simple checks – it analyzes player behavior, movement, and aim patterns to catch both rage cheaters and closet players trying to look legit. Unlike traditional plugins that only catch blatant rage hackers, CCD is designed to detect both rage cheaters (spinbot, rapidfire, flickbot) and closet cheaters (silent aim, triggerbot, subtle wallhack). It achieves this by tracking detailed player behavior and applying statistical analysis over time, instead of relying on random guesswork.***

## Requirements

- CounterStrikeSharp
- Metamod

## Features
